# MUSIC-Classification- using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

In this project, I will work upon classifying different musical genres from audio files. I will classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.
For this project I need a dataset of audio tracks with similar size and similar frequency range.
GTZAN genre classification dataset- Recommended dataset for the music genre classification.
